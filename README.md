# ML Cross-Validation Showcase

This repository presents an **industrial-style machine learning regression
pipeline** with a strong focus on cross-validation, reproducibility,
and clean project structure.

It is designed as a technical showcase for applied machine learning
workflows commonly used in engineering and industry.

---

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- End-to-end regression pipeline design
- Proper train/test splitting
- K-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Comparison of multiple regression models
- Clean and extensible project structure

---

## Cross-Validation Strategy

A K-fold cross-validation approach is applied to the training data to
ensure reliable performance estimates and to mitigate overfitting.

---

## Models Included

- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- CatBoost Regressor
- LightGBM Regressor
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- ElasticNet
- Decision Tree Regressor
